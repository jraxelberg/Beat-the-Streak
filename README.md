Enhancing Beat the Streak Odds through Machine Learning: A Tensorflow Neural Network Approach
Jason Axelberg and Joshua Koskie

Abstractâ€“This paper explores the application of machine learning, specifically a TensorFlow neural network approach, 
to enhance the odds of success in the "Beat the Streak" game created by Major League Baseball. The objective of the game 
is to beat the longest hitting streak in MLB history, set by Joe DiMaggio at 56 games. The declining popularity of baseball,
especially among younger generations, prompted the creation of this interactive game. The paper leverages extensive baseball data,
primarily sourced from pybaseball, to develop a predictive model based on batter performance metrics. The study focuses on key variables such as Hits per Game (HPG),
At Bats (ABS), Hits, Walks, and Strikeouts to improve the accuracy of predicting a player's likelihood of getting a hit in a given game.
The paper also discusses the limitations of the current model and proposes potential enhancements, including the incorporation of ballpark factors, weather conditions, and matchup-based data.

This was a final project for an AI class taken during J term. The time frame for this project was only weeks time.
